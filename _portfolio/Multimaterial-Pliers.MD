# Multimaterial FFF 3D Printed Pliers

---

## Features

- Designed on Autodesk Fusion 360 for both flexible joint and rigid structures, generated to promote capabilities in open and closed flexible states of pliers
- Fused-Filament Fabrication (FFF) printing was utilized with Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) and Polylactic Acid (PLA) materials
- TPU formed the flexible joint/pivot point of the pliers and PLA was used for the rigid handles and jaws of the pliers
- Print-in-place technique utilized for pivot point of pliers
- Rigid and flexible materials joined with separately printed parts linked together by clipping in

## Introduction and Description



---

### Print-in-place Parts

- Print-in-place models are designs that can come off the 3D printer and be completely functional without any post-process assembly. They are designed to work immediately after being taken off the print bed. This is achieved by designing clearances for joints, or in this case, utilizing the grid shape and no-fill format for TPU to create the flexible joint.

- Some single-material print-in-places may lead to unreliable movement or crunchy results but in multi-material, such as the project, utilizing flexible material like TPU can help promote more flexible motion on hinges.
