# Multimaterial FFA 3D Printed Pliers

---

## Features

- Designed with pinch flow fractionation (PFF) to promote particle separation based on size differences and the effects of water flow
- Resin mold created through CAD modeling using Autodesk Fusion 360 paired with a Form 4 clear resin printer
- Actual model created with PDMS casting and glass bonding for optical clarity and sealed channels for experimentation
- Uses 2.2 mm inlet and outlet ports for tube attachment (shown in gallery) 
- Channel walls are designed to be at least 3 mm from the device's edge to prevent breakage or failure in the mold creation process
- The minimum feature sizes are 85 µm in the (XY) and 25 µm (Z)
- An aspect ratio of 4:1 or less was respected to prevent taller features from breaking off during the demolding process
- Outlet channels were created to help balance hydraulic resistance within the device to optimize equalized flow for the particle streams
- Space within the device was optimized and made intentional to avoid bubble formation streamline disruption
