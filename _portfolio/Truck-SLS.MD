## Features

- **Generative Design Workflow:** Modeled using Autodesk Fusion 360's Generative Design extension. Instead of modeling the shape directly, the design was grown based on functional requirements, "preserve" geometries (axles, pivot cups), and "obstacle" geometries (wheels, ground, deck).
- **Part Consolidation:** Replaces a traditional multi-part assembly (hanger, clamping ring, motor mount bracket, and fasteners) with a single, monolithic component.
- **Multi-Material Optimization:** Solved simultaneously for two distinct manufacturing materials: Nylon 12 (SLS) and AlSi10Mg (Direct Metal Laser Sintering), highlighting how material properties influence topological outcomes.
- **Lightweighting:** Optimized to minimize mass while maintaining a safety factor against the static weight of the rider and the dynamic torsional torque of the electric motor.

## Introduction and Generative Methodology

This project focused on the application of Generative Design (GD) to address a gap in the Digital Fabrication Lab's transportation options. The objective was to build a custom electric longboard truck that integrates the motor mount directly into the hanger geometry. Unlike the "Top-Down" approach used in previous projects, this workflow utilized *computational synthesis*.

The core engineering challenge was shifting from explicitly drawing geometry to defining the *problem definition*.

### Leveraging the Generative Workspace

The CAD process began by defining the "Preserve Geometry"—the critical interfaces that must remain (the axle housing, the pivot cup, and the kingpin bushing seat). "Obstacle Geometry" was then modeled to represent areas where material *cannot* go, such as the spinning wheels, the ground clearance zone, and the turning radius of the deck.

Forces were applied to these preserves, and Fusion 360's cloud solvers generated hundreds of iterations, removing material from low-stress areas and reinforcing high-stress load paths. This resulted in an organic, lattice-like structure that a human engineer would be unlikely to design manually.

## Discussion and Design Rationale

### Industry Application: Powder Bed Fusion & Generative Design
The pairing of Generative Design with Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) represents a paradigm shift in industries like aerospace and automotive. Traditional subtraction methods (CNC) cannot easily manufacture the hollow, organic shapes GD produces. PBF removes these constraints.

A specific commercial example of this is the **General Motors seat bracket**. GM used generative design to consolidate a standard seat bracket assembly—originally 8 separate stamped steel parts—into a **single stainless steel component**. The result was 40% lighter and 20% stronger. This mirrors the goal of this project: reducing the truck assembly from a clamped system to a singular, efficient unit.

### Load Cases and Constraints
Applying proper load cases is the most critical step; the solver only reacts to forces explicitly defined. For this truck, three primary loads were applied:
* **Vertical Load:** The weight of the rider distributed through the bushings.
* **Dynamic Shock:** 3-4x the static load to account for road bumps.
* **Torsional Load:** The torque generated by the 6374 brushless motor pulling on the belt, attempting to twist the mount.

I constrained the pivot cup and kingpin hole as fixed anchor points. These constraints dictated the "roots" from which the material grew.

### Material Comparison: Nylon 12 vs. AlSi10Mg
The generative outcomes differed significantly based on material stiffness:
* **Nylon 12 (SLS):** The nylon outcome was significantly bulkier. Because Nylon has a lower Young's Modulus, the algorithm generated thick, branch-like structures to resist deflection. While durable, Nylon serves as a thermal insulator, which is less ideal for a motor mount that needs to dissipate heat.
* **AlSi10Mg (Aluminum):** The aluminum outcome was fine and lattice-like. The high stiffness of the metal allowed for thin struts to carry the same load. This is the superior choice for this application, as the aluminum hanger acts as a heatsink for the motor.

### Critique of Generative Design
While powerful, GD is not without drawbacks. The "organic" geometry is difficult to verify using standard measurements and nearly impossible to modify manually if the design requirements change later. Additionally, "finished" prints still require precision post-processing (machining) for bearing interfaces, meaning it is not truly a "click print" solution.

## Improvements and Iteration

Upon receiving the final print and attempting assembly, several dimensional and geometric constraints were identified that need correction in "Version 2":

### 1. Motor Mount Position (Belt Track)
The most critical error was the placement of the motor preservation geometry. I placed the motor mount too far from the axle center.
* **The Issue:** The supplied timing belt was too short to connect the motor pulley to the wheel pulley.
* **The Fix:** In the next iteration, I need to adjust the "Obstacle Geometry" to force the motor mount 10-15mm closer to the hanger. This will allow the belt to fit with adequate slack for tensioning.

### 2. Kingpin Hole Tolerance
The central hole for the kingpin was modeled at exact nominal dimensions (9.5mm).
* **The Issue:** Due to thermal shrinkage during the sintering process, the hole printed undersized, and the truck could not fit onto the baseplate kingpin without drilling.
* **The Fix:** I must apply a +0.2mm to +0.3mm offset to the preservation geometry to account for manufacturing tolerance and shrinkage.

### 3. Axle Rod Clearance
Similarly, the through-hole for the main steel axle rod was too tight.
* **The Issue:** The rod could not pass through the hanger body.
* **The Fix:** The internal diameter of the axle support structure needs to be increased to create a "clearance fit" rather than an interference fit, allowing the rod to slide through freely.

## Fabrication

### Printing Technology
* **Prototype:** Printed in Nylon 12 using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) on a Formlabs Fuse 1.
* **Final Production:** The final design is intended for AlSi10Mg using Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS).
* **Resolution:** 100-micron layer height for Nylon 12.
